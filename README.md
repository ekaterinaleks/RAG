# üé¨ RAG-based Movie and Series Recommendation System

## üìå Overview

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**-based movie recommendation system. It leverages the following models and tools:
- **Pinecone** as vector database used for storing and retrieval of candidates for recommendation
- **Hybrid search** using dense and sparse vectors calculated with
    - **E5-base-v2** with 12 layers and the embedding size of 768 for embedding dense vectors
    - **Sparse Lexical and Expansion model, or SPLADE** for getting BERT-enriched sparse vectors
- **Llama 3.2 3B model** used locally via **Ollama** for Zero-shot classification
- **OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model** used to generate final movie recommendations (a combination of structured and conversational response) based on user queries.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Zero-shot classification with LLM** for metadata filtering at retrieval stage

    Zero-shot classification is carried out utilizing **Llama 3.2 3B** model via **Ollama** with structured output via Pydantic BaseModel and TypedDict. It is applied to infer key metadata like genres, show types, years, and countries of production for user queries and genres and show types for movies from the database. This enables efficient filtering at the retrieval stage, improving search relevance and reducing unnecessary processing. However, in order to counteract potentially limiting effects if the filters, the filtering is done in three steps with gradually less strict filters to allow for broader spectrum of candidates.

- **Hybrid search** (dense and sparse embeddings) using **Pinecone** index

    The retrieval step is performed using hybrid vector search. The choice of **Pinecone** as vector database is due to both its low-latency retrieval and the option of using SPLADE for hybrid search. Combining dense vectors (in our case, **E5-base-v2** with 768 dimensions) and SPLADE (Sparse Lexical and Expansion) vectors enhances RAG by leveraging the strengths of both semantic and lexical retrieval. Dense vectors capture deep contextual meanings, improving recall for queries with complex or implicit intent, while SPLADE expands sparse keyword representations, ensuring precise keyword matching.

- **Conversational and structured AI output**

    The final AI output generated with **OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model** combines a conversational user-friendly reply and a structured part with detailed information about each recommendation ranging from metadata extacted from retrieved documents, like title, links to IMDB, etc., and rating to reasoning behind each recommendation in particular.



## ‚öôÔ∏è Main Steps

1. **Dataset EDA, Cleanup and Feature Engineering**: EDA with pandas profiling, final dataset curation, including inferring categories for imputing missing values (Genres) or adding a new field (Show types).
2. **Indexing**: Movie data is embedded into dense and sparse vectors, and sent to Pinecone with metadata.
3. **User query processing**: The zero-shot classifier extracts from user's query metadata that can be used to construct filters at retrieval stage.
4. **Retrieval**: The system retrieves documents about the most relevant videos for the user's query.
5. **Generation**: The system outputs a conversational response and a curated list of the top 5 movie recommendations with individual reasoning for each recommendation.

I recommend 'The Woman in White' and 'The Hound of the Baskervilles: Sherlock the Movie' for their adaptation from books and UK filming locations. Additionally, 'Reichenbach Falls' offers a psychological thriller set in Edinburgh, while 'A Very English Murder' presents a classic detective story during Christmas. Lastly, 'Jigsaw' follows local detectives along the coast from Brighton in solving a murder case.
